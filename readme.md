### Background:
**"Minina's Matchup Adventure"** was conceived out of a passion for memory games and a desire to showcase the charm of my cat, Minina. This game embodies a perfect fusion of these two elements, offering an engaging and delightful experience.

A little bit about Minina: she's a 6-year-old female American Shorthair rescue cat who adores treats, appreciates the occasional hug, and finds pure bliss in her favorite pastime‚Äînapping. üêæ

Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to match all of the cards on the screen before the timer runs out and before you're out of moves. Minina's watchful eye is on you as the timer ticks down, and you'll need to sharpen your memory and quick thinking to succeed. 

The game contains three levels to choose from, and you may start at any of them.

#### Game Rules:
Follow these instructions to prove you're the ultimate cat-themed card matcher!

1. Start by choosing a card.
After selecting your first card, choose another one.
2. If the cards match, you earn a point, and both cards stay face up.
Keep making matches to earn more points.
3. If you choose two cards that don't match, the second card will flip back over, and you'll lose a move.
4. Every successful match keeps the cards face up and earns you points.
